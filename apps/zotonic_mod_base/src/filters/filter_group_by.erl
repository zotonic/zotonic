-module(filter_group_by).

Groups items of a list by a property.

An item can be an *id*, a *proplist* or a *map*.

- When the item is an integer then it is assumed to be the *id* of a resource.
- This is especially useful for grouping items in for-loops.

For example:

```django
{% for grp in value|group_by:\"a\" %} ... loop over grp ... {% endfor %}
```

When value is the three element list:


```django
[
 [{a, 1}, {b, 1}],
 [{a, 1}, {b, 2}],
 [{a, 2}, {b, 3}]
]
```

then the output of group\\_by “a” will be the two element list:


```django
[
 [ [{a, 1}, {b, 1}], [{a, 1}, {b, 2}] ],
 [ [{a, 2}, {b, 3}] ]
].
```
").
-export([group_by/3]).


group_by(In, undefined, _Context) ->

group_by(undefined, _, _Context) ->

        z_template_compiler_runtime:to_list(In, Context),
        z_convert:to_atom(Prop),
        Context).
