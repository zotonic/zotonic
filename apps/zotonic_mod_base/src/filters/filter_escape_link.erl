Convert any URLs in a plaintext into HTML links, with adding the `rel=\"nofollow\"` attribute, and replaces all newlines
with `<br\\>` tags.

Example:


```django
{{ \"Hello http://foo.bar/\\n\\nAnd bye.\"|escape_link }}
```

Outputs:


```django
\"Hello <a href=\"http://foo.bar/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">http://foo.bar/</a><br /><br />And bye.\"
```

This filter is very useful when displaying user-generated plaintexts, like comments.
