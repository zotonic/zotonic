HTML escape a text. Escapes all reserved HTML characters in the value. Escaped strings are safe to be displayed in a
HTML page. When you echo a query string argument or path variable then you must escape the value before displaying it on
a HTML page.

The following characters are replaced:

| Character | Replacement |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `\\\\>`     | `&gt;`      |
| `<`       | `&lt;`      |
| `\"`       | `&quot;`    |
| `'`       | `&#039;`    |
| `&`       | `&amp;`     |

The escaping is only applied if the filter is not within an `{% autoescape on %}` block. If you always want escaping to
be applied, use the [force\\_escape](/id/doc_template_filter_filter_force_escape) filter.

For example:


```django
{{ value|escape }}
```

When the value is `<hel&lo\\>` then the output is `&lt;hel&amp;lo&gt;`.

Note: this filter is not part of a module, it is built into the template compiler.
