[split\\_in](/id/doc_template_filter_filter_split_in), [vsplit\\_in](/id/doc_template_filter_filter_vsplit_in)

This filter splits a list in shorter lists. It splits an array in sub-arrays of at most a given length. This is useful
when displaying a list of items in columns or rows.

For example:


```django
{% for s in [1,2,3,4,5]|chunk:2 %}
    {% for n in s %}{{ n|format_number }} {% endfor %} *
{% endfor %}
```

This displays `1 2 * 3 4 * 5 *`, as the array is split in three chunks. The last chunk is not filled to the maximum
length. Then number of chunks depends on the length of the input list, this in contrary to the split\\_in filters where
the number of splits is fixed and the length per split is variable.
