[chunk](/id/doc_template_filter_filter_chunk), [split\\_in](/id/doc_template_filter_filter_split_in)

This filter splits a list in shorter lists. It splits an array in N sub-arrays of more or less equal length. This is
useful when displaying a list of items in columns.

Note that it splits the array in a different way than [split\\_in](/id/doc_template_filter_filter_split_in) does: The
filter split\\_in takes alternating elements from the array, where vsplit\\_in takes complete runs at a time. See the
example below.

For example:


```django
{% with [1,2,3,4,5,6]|vsplit_in:3 as a,b,c %}
    {% for n in a %}{{ n|format_number }} {% endfor %}
{% endwith %}
```

This displays `1 2`. The variable b will be `[3,4]` and the variable c will be `[5,6]`.
