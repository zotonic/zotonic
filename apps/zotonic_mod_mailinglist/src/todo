To do for mod_mailinglist.

Required:
- Template/scomp for subscribing to mailing list (for in front end)
- Add recipient by non-editor -> send confirm instead of welcome/silent.

Nice to have:
- Search for e-mail address in recipient list
- Show scheduled mailings in mailing list overview

And finally:
- Check security
- Check front end page templates.  We need to standardize these templates.
