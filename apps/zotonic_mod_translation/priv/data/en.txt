'''World War II''' was the most extensive and costly [[war|armed conflict]] in the [[history of the world]], involving the great majority of the world's [[nation]]s, being fought simultaneously in several major theatres, and costing tens of millions of lives.

The German [[Polish September Campaign|invasion of Poland]] on [[September 1]] [[1939]] is the most common date in the West for the start of World War II. Others cite the Japanese invasion of China on [[July 7]], [[1937]], as the war's beginning, or even the [[1931]] Japanese incursion into [[Manchuria]]. The war ended in Europe with the surrender of Germany on [[May 8]], [[1945]], but continued in Asia and the Pacific until the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] and the subsequent [[V-J Day|Japanese surrender]] on [[September 2]] [[1945]].

There are several main [[Causes of World War II|causes of this conflict]], most important being unforeseen consequences of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended [[World War I]], and of the [[Great Depression]], the worldwide economic disaster gave rise to [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]]. The lead-up to the war stretches back to [[Events preceding World War II in Europe|build-ups and smaller regional wars]] of the [[1930]]s, which slowly drew in more countries and culminated in massive battles with millions of combatants in the first half of the [[1940s]].

Fighting occurred across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theatre]] in and around eastern and western [[Europe]], in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] as well as across the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] in the [[Pacific]], in [[Oceania]] and across much of [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]].

It was the first war in which air power was a significant factor and [[civilian]] suffering and terror a primary military strategy. The war [[list of World War II casualties by country|caused more casualties than any war in history]]. This was partly due to its unprecedented scale, the first uses of mass aerial bombings against civilian populations (a policy initiated by the German [[Luftwaffe]] against Poland and later used more extensively against German cities by the Allies), and the first application of industrial-age technology to enable the mass killing of unwanted civilians in [[extermination camp]]s; a significant part of the German war machine was diverted towards the execution of [[Jew]]s, [[Roma]], [[Slavs]] and other unwanted citizens in the [[Holocaust]]. In total, World War II caused the deaths of about two percent of the [[World population|population of the world]].

The war also saw the re-emergence of the United States from its [[isolationism]], the destruction and rebuilding of Germany and Japan into major industrial powers, the advent of the [[atomic bomb]], the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as global [[superpower]]s, closer integration of Europe in the form of a [[European Union]], the dissolution of the [[League of Nations]] and creation of the [[United Nations]], founded by the victorious Allies in order to prevent such a large and destructive conflict from ever happening again.

The post-war period set the stage for the [[Cold War]], with the [[Western Allies]] and most of [[Western Europe]] including [[West German]]y, [[Italy]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] forming [[NATO]], and the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Eastern Europe]] [[Satellite states|satellite]]s creating the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The struggle for dominance between these two alliances would last until the collapse of the Soviet Union in [[1991]].

==Participants==
''Main article: [[Participants in World War II]]''

Traditionally, the war is described as a conflict between two groups of powers: the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] and the [[Allies]]. The primary members of the Allies were the [[British Commonwealth]], the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]]. The Axis primarily consisted of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], and the [[Empire of Japan]].

In reality, this network of alliances changed over time, with divisions within countries, shifts in alliances, and questionable practices by supposedly neutral countries. Countries that highlight complication with the Allied&ndash;Axis categorization include:

* [[France]], which was Allied at the start of the war, but was later divided into [[Vichy France]] and a German occupational government, with the [[Free French Forces]] controlling some French colonies;
* [[Italy]], where the association with Nazi Germany remained controversial and tentative until the German conquest of France, and which later surrendered to and joined the Allies following its invasion by Allied forces;
* The [[Soviet Union]], which actively participated in the invasion of [[Poland]] in a partnership with Nazi Germany, and extended its territory in [[the Baltics]] with German approval, but joined the Allies following an invasion by Nazi Germany in June [[1941]] which broke the [[Molotow-Ribbentrop Pact]] between them;
* [[Finland]], which initially received Allied sympathy, and some support, while defending itself from the Soviet invasion of the [[Winter War]] &mdash; a sympathy that diminished starkly after the aforementioned invasion of the Soviet Union, when the Red Army in the [[Continuation War]] attacked Finland again. In this conflict, Finland's northern part was defended by German forces, and Britain, but not the United States, [[declaration of war|declared war]] on Finland in support of the Soviet action.

In addition, many countries, although avowedly neutral, provided military volunteers and other support either to the Allies or to the Axis. For example, [[Spain]] supplied [[Blue Division|troops]] for use by Germany.

==Causes==
''Main article: [[Causes of World War II]]''

The Second World War originated from a variety of causes. Some of the most commonly mentioned include the aggressive rise of [[totalitarian]] [[ideology|ideologies]], and, from a narrower perspective, [[war reparation]]s demanded of Germany after [[World War I]], coupled with the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and the lack of raw materials in Japan.

The [[economic depression]] and [[inflation]] of these latter nations' [[currency]] contributed to the rise of [[facism|fascist]] ideals and fervent [[nationalism]], which, in turn, led to the [[militarism|militarization]] of the economy and mobilization of forces along key borders in these nations. With the rise of fascism, the foreign policies of the Axis nations became more aggressive and strained the Allied leadership.

==Prelude to War==
''Main article: [[Events preceding World War II in Europe]], [[Events preceding World War II in Asia]]''

Resentment of the victorious [[Power (international)|powers]]' treatment of the [[Weimar Republic]] in the [[aftermath of World War I]] and economic difficulties caused by [[war reparation]]s and the Great Depression allowed [[Adolf Hitler]]'s extreme [[nationalist]] [[NSDAP]] movement to come to power in Germany. Due to the fragile political situation, Hitler was able to assume emergency powers and virtual total control of the country.

Defying post-WWI treaties, he re-developed the German military by means of the democratic constitution that was later put aside. He re-militarised the border zone next to France, enforced the re-unification with [[Austria]] in the so-called [[Anschluss]], and with Franco-British approval he annexed parts of [[Czechoslovakia]].

In [[1922]] [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[Fascist]] party had risen to power in Italy. Mussolini's Italian fascists shared some ideological goals with the German [[National Socialist]]s or Nazis and, although Mussolini distrusted Hitler, the two countries formed an agreement that became known as the "Rome-Berlin Axis" in 1936.


In the east, [[Japan]] had, as early as the late nineteenth century, begun to spread out across Asia, brought about by conflict between traditional Japanese practices and changing social conditions associated with rapid [[industrialization|industrialisation]] and [[modernization|modernisation]]. In [[1905]] Japan won an astounding victory over [[Russia]], and in [[1910]] it occupied [[Korea]] and made it a colony.

During the [[1920s]] democracy seemed to be taking root in Japan, but by 
the [[1930s]], the [[Great Depression]] brought to the fore many talented military leaders who took control of Japan, often ruling in the name of Emperor [[Hirohito]], and playing on the traditional respect the Japanese people held for their emperors. In [[1931]], Japan invaded and occupied [[Inner Manchuria]], setting up the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]], and by [[1937]] launched a second invasion that occupied the rest of the region. For this reason, some scholars consider 1936/37 the actual start of World War II.

== European Theatre ==
''Main article: [[European Theatre of World War II]], [[The end of World War II in Europe]]''

In [[1939]], Hitler laid claim to parts of [[Poland]] and concluded the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] in response to Britain's and France's supportive defence alliance with Poland of March 1939.

The German [[Wehrmacht]] then [[Polish September Campaign|invaded Poland]] on [[1 September]], and on [[3 September]] [[1939]], Britain and France declared war on Germany (''[[Media:Chamberlain-war-declaration.mp3|Listen to Neville Chamberlain declaring war on Germany]] (MP3, 1.32MB)''), however neither French nor British troops [[Western_betrayal#The_Phony_War|gave any significant assistance to the Poles]] during the entire September Campaign.

On [[17 September]] the Soviet [[Red Army]] joined the invasion, and, hours after that, the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish government]] [[Romanian Bridgehead|evacuated the country for Romania]]. Hostilities in Poland ended on [[6 October]] with the final [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]]. Over the following months [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poland managed to rebuild its armies]] in France and Britain and remained an important combatant throughout the entire war.

In October ''[[Unterseeboot 47|U-47]]'' sank [[HMS Royal Oak|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] in [[Scapa Flow]] and the [[Luftwaffe]] carried out bombing raids on British naval bases at [[Rosyth]] and [[Scapa Flow]].

In December [[1939]], the German [[pocket battleship]] [[Admiral Graf Spee]] engaged British naval forces in the [[Battle of the River Plate]] in South America. The German warship retreated into [[Montevideo]] harbour and was scuttled shortly thereafter.

The period from the conclusion of the invasion of Poland in October 1939 until the German invasion of the [[Benelux]] countries and [[France]] in May 1940, became known as the ''[[Phony War]]''. The German and Soviet forces were moved from the attack on Poland. The Red Army concentrated on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] countries and on [[Finland]], where the [[Winter War]] became a focus of the world's interest in the absence of other hostilities.

Meanwhile, the Wehrmacht moved north and invaded Denmark and Norway in [[Operation Weserübung]]. France mobilised and manned its heavily-defended border (The [[Maginot Line]]) against the [[Rhine]] and the British sent a large expeditionary force to France. However, apart from a brief attack by the French across the Rhine, there were little in the way of hostilities as both sides built up their forces.

In May of 1940 German forces attacked the [[Low Countries]] ([[The Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]). The three countries were occupied quickly, all of their governments and monarchs fleeing to [[London]], except for the Belgian king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] who stayed in his country.

[[France]] was then invaded via the Low Countries, bypassing the Maginot Line. The Germans' [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics succeeded in defeating the French and British armies in France. The [[British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) evacuated from [[Dunkirk]] in [[Operation Dynamo]], leaving their heavy equipment and their French allies behind. When German tanks overran most of France, the French State collapsed and a new government made a peace, leaving the Germans in control of the North and the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in (nominal) charge of the South.

The [[Luftwaffe]] was unable to defeat the [[Royal Air Force]] in the [[Battle of Britain]] and gain the air superiority needed to invade Britain. Instead, they began a [[strategic bombing]] campaign, which the British called [[the Blitz]], and attempted to blockade Britain into submission in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1940)|Battle of the Atlantic]]. Britain failed to succumb to either tactic.

Meanwhile the geography of the Europe was changed: Soviet Union occupied [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]] (June, [[1940]]), and  annexed [[Bessarabia]] and Northern [[Bukovina]] from [[Romania]] ([[June 28]] [[1940]]).

[[Italy]] attacked [[Greece]] on October 28 1940 and suffered the first [[Axis]] defeat. Though [[Hitler]] had no plans for Greece at that time, he was forced  to send troops to occupy Greece (since Greece's [[neutral country|neutrality]] was broken) on April of 1941. This resulted in the delay of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the loss of precious troops (see the [[Battle of Crete]]).

In June 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union, with whom they had previously signed a [[non-aggression pact]], starting what is known in Russia as the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[Russian language|ru]]:, ''Velikaya Otechestvennaya Voyna''). The Russians were caught largely by surprise and the Wehrmacht initially conquered vast areas of territory, capturing hundreds of thousands of troops.

The Soviets withdrew, and managed to move most of their heavy industry away from the front line and re-establish it in more remote areas. Tenacious, sacrificial defence prevented the Germans from capturing [[Moscow]] ([[Hero City]]) by the time winter set in (see [[Battle of Moscow]]). Hitler, expecting the campaign to be over in a few months, had not equipped their armies for winter fighting.

Five days after the Soviets launched their counter-attack on [[December 11]], [[1941]], Germany declared war on the United States following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] by [[Japan]] - see [[World_War_II#Asian_Theatre|Asian Theatre]].


In spring, the German army made further attacks on the Soviet Union but appeared to be unable to choose between a direct attack on [[Moscow]] and the capture of the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] oilfields. Moscow was again spared and, at the end of 1942, the Soviets succeeded in smashing the Axis' front lines in the south and surrounding the German 6th Army, originally comprised of 300,000 men, in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] ([[Hero City]]).

In February 1943, the paltry remnant of the 6th Army surrendered. The loss could have been avoided had Hitler taken Stalingrad when it was devoid of Soviet troops; however, he mistakenly believed it was too well defended. In retrospect, Goebbels' [[Sportpalast speech]] marks their recognition that [[total war]] was a necessary response to the Allies' advances.

In the spring, the Wehrmacht was able to restore the front line and make a successful riposte in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]] but their offensive at the massive [[Battle of Kursk]] (July 1943) was so unsuccessful that the Red Army were able to counterattack and regain the ground previously lost.

From that time forward, the Soviet Union had the initiative in the East. By early 1944, the Red Army had reached the border of Poland and ended the [[Siege of Leningrad]].

The German disaster at Stalingrad was promptly followed by a disaster of similar importance in Tunisia (see [[World War II#African and Middle Eastern Theatre|African theatre]] below), resulting in the loss of the last Axis foothold in North Africa and the capture of a quarter of a million German and Italian [[POW]]s (May 1943).

Thereafter, the Allies used North Africa as a springboard for the [[Operation Husky|invasion of Sicily]] (July 1943) and [[Allied invasion of Italy|mainland Italy]] (September 1943), which [[Winston Churchill]] described as "the soft underbelly of Europe".

Italy surrendered but German troops moved to disarm the Italians and set about defending the country on their own. They established a series of tough defensive lines in mountainous country that was ideally suited to defence and progress by the Allies was slow.

The Allies invaded [[Normandy]] in [[Operation Overlord]] on [[June 6]] [[1944]] and liberated most of France and the Low Countries by the end of the year.

On [[June 9]], the Soviet Union began an offensive on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], forcing German co-belligerent Finland out of the war. On [[June 22]], the Soviets began [[Operation Bagration]]; 2.5 million men and 6,000 tanks attacked along a 1,000-kilometre front, completely destroying the 500,000-man German [[Army Group Centre]] and taking 350,000 prisoners.

Romania surrendered in August and Bulgaria on September. The Germans withdrew from Balkans and managed to hold their position in Hungary until February 1945.

After a desperate counteroffensive by the German army in the Ardennes during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944, the Allies entered Germany in [[1945]]. By now, the Soviets had reached the eastern borders of the German [[Reich]] and her fate was sealed.

The Red Army captured [[Vienna]] on [[April 14]] and the final assault on Berlin began on [[April 16]]. As the Russians surrounded [[Berlin]], Hitler and his staff moved into the bunker underneath the Chancellery. There, on [[30 April]] [[1945]], Adolf Hitler committed suicide as Russian shells exploded in the Chancellery garden above.

It had been twelve years and three months since the time he had become dictator of Germany. He had appointed Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] President of Germany prior to his suicide but, one week later, the German armed forces surrendered unconditionally on [[8 May]] [[1945]] (the documents were signed on [[7 May]] and the surrender to Soviet forces occurred on [[9 May]]).

Throughout the period of the war, [[Ireland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[Sweden]] remained officially [[neutral country|neutral]]. In Ireland, the conflict is referred to as [[The Emergency]].

== Pacific Theatre ==

''Main article: [[Pacific War]]''

In 1940, Japan occupied French Indochina (Vietnam) upon agreement with the [[Vichy Government]] and despite local Free French, and joined the Axis powers Germany and Italy. These actions intensified Japan's conflict with the United States and the United Kingdom which reacted with an oil boycott.

The Japanese had already invaded [[China]] before World War II started in Europe. U.S. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] signed an executive order in May of 1940 allowing U.S. military personnel to resign from the service so that they could participate in a covert operation in China. Hence was born the All Volunteer Group, more commonly known as Chennault's [[Flying Tigers]]. With the United States and other countries cutting exports to Japan, Japan decided to [[attack on Pearl Harbor|bomb Pearl Harbor]] on [[7 December]] [[1941]] without warning or declaration of war. Severe damage was done to the American [[Pacific Fleet]], although the [[aircraft carrier]]s escaped as they were at sea. Japanese forces simultaneously invaded the British possessions of [[Malaya]] and [[Borneo]] and the American occupied [[Philippines]], with the intention of seizing the oilfields of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The British island fortress of [[Singapore]] was captured in what Churchill considered one of the most humiliating British defeats of all time.

In May 1942, the Allied navies in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] thwarted a Japanese naval attack on [[Port Moresby]], [[New Guinea]] which had it succeeded would have put them within striking range of [[Australia]]. This was both the first successful opposition to Japanese plans and the first naval battle fought only between aircraft carriers. A month later the U.S. Navy again prevented the invasion of [[Battle of Midway|Midway Island]], this time destroying four Japanese carriers, which Japanese industry could not replace, and putting the Japanese navy on the defensive.

However, in July the Japanese Army attempted an overland attack on Port Moresby, along the rugged [[Kokoda Track]]. Australian reservists, many of them very young and untrained, fought a stubborn rearguard action, until they were relieved by Australian regular troops returning from action in the [[Middle East]].

The Allied leaders had agreed even prior to the American entry to the war that priority should be given to the defeat of Germany. Nonetheless US and Australian forces under General [[Douglas MacArthur]] began to attack captured territories, beginning with, against the bitter and determined defence of Japanese troops, [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Island]]. On [[7 August]] [[1942]] the island was assaulted by [[United States Marines]]. In late August and early September, while battle raged on Guadalcanal, Australian forces fought off a Japanese amphibious attack on the eastern tip of New Guinea at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]], the first conclusive defeat suffered by Japanese land forces. US forces triumphed on Guadalcanal in February 1943.

Exhausted Australian and US forces then strove to retake the occupied parts of [[New Guinea]] and the Dutch East Indies, experiencing some of the toughest resistance of the Pacific Theatre. The rest of the [[Solomon Islands]] were retaken in 1943, [[New Britain]] and [[New Ireland]] in 1944. The Philippines were attacked in late 1944 following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].

US and Allied submarines and aircraft also attacked Japanese merchant shipping, depriving Japanese industry of the raw materials she had gone to war to obtain. The effectiveness of this stranglehold increased as the U.S. captured islands closer to the Japanese mainland.

The Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] Army under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] Chinese Army under [[Mao Zedong]] both opposed the Japanese occupation of China, but never truly allied against the Japanese. Conflict between Nationalist and Communist forces continued after and, to an extent, even during the war.

Capture by the Allies of islands such as [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] close to Japan brought the homeland within range of naval and air attacks, [[Tokyo]] was firebombed and later an [[atomic bomb]], the "Little Boy", was dropped from the B-29 "Enola Gay" and destroyed [[Hiroshima]]. On [[8 August]] [[1945]] the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, as had been agreed to at Yalta, and launched a large scale invasion of Japanese occupied Manchuria (operation [[August Storm]]). On [[August 9]], in [[Nagasaki]], another atom bomb, "Fat Man" was dropped by the B-29 "Bock's Car". The Japanese surrendered on [[14 August]] [[1945]], signing official surrender papers on [[2 September]] [[1945]] aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.

== African and Middle Eastern Theatre ==
The [[North African Campaign]] began in [[1940]], when small British forces in [[Egypt]] turned back an Italian advance from [[Libya]]. This advance was stopped in [[1941]] when German forces under [[Erwin Rommel]] landed in Libya.  In addition, in [[June]] [[1941]] the [[Australian Army]] and allied forces invaded [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], capturing [[Damascus]] on [[17 June]]. Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]] advanced rapidly eastward, laying siege to the vital seaport of [[Tobruk]]. The Australian and British troops in the city resisted all until relieved, but a renewed Axis offensive captured the city and drove the Eighth Army back to a line at [[El Alamein]].

The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] took place between [[July 1]] and [[July 27]], [[1942]]. German forces had advanced to the last defensible point before [[Alexandria]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. However they had outrun their supplies, and a British and Commonwealth defence stopped their thrusts. The [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] occurred between [[October 23]] and [[November 3]], [[1942]] after [[Bernard Montgomery]] had replaced [[Claude Auchinleck]] as commander of the Eighth Army. Commonwealth forces took the offensive and destroyed the Afrika Korps. Rommel was pushed back, and this time did not stop falling back until [[Tunisia]].

To complement this victory, on [[8 November]] [[1942]], American and British troops landed in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in [[Operation Torch]]. The local forces of [[Vichy France]] put up limited resistance before joining the Allied cause. Ultimately German and Italian forces were caught in the pincers of a twin advance from [[Algeria]] and Libya. Advancing from both the east and west, the Allies completely pushed the Wehrmacht out of [[Africa]] and on [[May 13]], [[1943]], the remnants of the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered. 250,000 prisoners were taken; as many as at [[Stalingrad]].

North Africa was used as the jumping-off point for the invasions of [[Sicily]] and mainland [[Italy]] in 1943.

==Consequences==

In contrast to [[World War I]], the Western victors in the Second World War did not demand compensation from the defeated nations. On the contrary, a plan created by U. S. Secretary of State [[George Marshall]], the "European Recovery Program", better known as the [[Marshall Plan]], called for the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] to allocate billions of dollars for the reconstruction of [[Europe]]. Also as part of the effort to rebuild global capitalism and spur post-war reconstruction, the [[Bretton Woods system]] was put into effect after the war.

Since the [[League of Nations]] had obviously failed to prevent the war, a new international order was constructed. In 1945 the [[United Nations]] was founded. Also, in order to prevent such devastating war from occurring again and to establish a lasting peace in Europe, the [[ECSC|European Coal and Steel Community]] was born in 1951 ([[Treaty of Paris (1951)]]), which became the predecessor of the [[European Union]].

The future [[Warsaw Pact]] countries did not subscribe to the Marshall Plan.  In the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]], the Soviet Union's enemies [[Hungary]], [[Finland]] and [[Romania]] were required to pay [[war reparations]] of $300,000,000 each (in 1938 dollars) to the USSR. [[Italy]] was required to pay $360,000,000, shared chiefly between [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the Soviet Union.

In the areas occupied by Western Allied troops, capitalist governments were created, in the areas occupied by Soviet troops, communist governments were created. Germany was partitioned into four zones of occupation, with the American, British and French zones grouped as [[West Germany]] and the Soviet zone as [[East Germany]]. [[Austria]] was once again separated from Germany and it, too, was divided into four zones of occupation which eventually re-united and became the state of Austria. The [[Cold War]] had begun, and soon [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] would form.

The repatriation, pursuant to the terms of the [[Yalta Conference]], of two million Russian soldiers who had come under the control of advancing American and British forces, resulted for the most part in their deaths.

The massive research and development involved in the [[Manhattan Project]] in order to quickly achieve a working [[nuclear weapon design]] greatly impacted the scientific community, among other things creating a network of national laboratories in the United States. In addition, the pressing for numerous calculations for various things like [[Colossus computer|code breaking]] and ballistics tables kickstarted the development of electronic [[computer]] technology.

In the military sphere, World War II marked the coming of age of airpower, mostly at the expense of warships. While the pendulum continues to swing in this never-ending competition, air powers are now a full partner in any military action. World War II also saw the creation of [[guided missile]]s which, like airpower, are now used in virtually every conflict.

The war was the high-water mark for mass armies. While huge armies of low-quality troops would be seen again (during the [[Korean War]] and in a number of African conflicts), after this victory the major powers relied upon small highly-trained and well-equipped militaries.

After the war, many high-ranking Germans were prosecuted for [[war crime]]s, as well as the mass murder of the [[Holocaust]] committed mainly on the area of [[General Government]], in the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Similarly Japanese leaders were prosecuted in the [[Tokyo War Crime Trial]]. Although the deliberate targeting of civilians was already defined as a war crime and it had been used extensively by both sides, most notably in Poland, Britain, Germany and Japan, those responsible were never tried for it. In other countries, notably in Finland, the Allies demanded the political leadership to be prosecuted in "[[war-responsibility trials]]" &mdash; i.e. not for ''crimes'' of war.

The defeat of Japan, and her occupation by American Forces, led to a [[westernization]] of Japan that was surely more far-reaching than would otherwise have occurred. Japan approximated more closely to a Western style democracy and, because of her defeat by the USA, set out to imitate the United States. This huge national effort led to the post-war Japanese economic miracle and Japan's rise to become the world's second largest economy.

The destruction of Europe and the destruction, via aerial bombing, of a significant proportion of the United Kingdom's cities would also symbolically destroy the aura of invincibility the European nation had in the eyes of their colonies. Coupled with the enormous amount of money it had expended during the war, an empire was perceived to be an unnecessarily expensive possession. Thus this would provoke the rapid [[decolonisation]] process that would see the empires of the United Kingdom, France and others swept away.

== Production and logistics == 

The Axis lost, at least partly because the Allies, after the USA's and the Soviet Union's entrance into the war, had greater productive resources, and were able to turn these resources into greater numbers of soldiers and weapons than the Axis. This was further compounded by the comparative lack of equipment standardization among the Axis forces and its failure to use its large territorial (and associated resources) gains in an economy on war footing. For instance Germany was the only war economy which largely didn't make use of the labour of women.
