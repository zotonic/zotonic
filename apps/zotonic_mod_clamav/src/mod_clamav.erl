-module(mod_clamav).
-moduledoc("
Uses `clamd` to scan all uploaded files for viruses.

The scanning happens after the mime type and access control is checked, but before the sanitization. If a file is
infected then the error `infected` will be returned. The admin will display a growl message telling that the file was infected.

Clamd has a maximum size for checks, above that size the error `sizelimit` will be returned.

Configure in the `zotonic.config` file where `clamd` is listening.

The following configs are available:

`clamav_ip`

IP address of `clamd`, default to `\"127.0.0.1\"`

`clamav_port`

Port of `clamd`, default to `3310`

`clamav_max_size`

The **StreamMaxLength** of `clamd`, default to `26214400` (25M)

`clamav_reject_msoffice_external_links`

Reject Microsoft Office documents containing `externalLinks` information. If the Zotonic config is set to `false` then
rejection can be forced by setting the site’s config key `mod_clamav.reject_msoffice_external_links` to `1`. Defaults
to `true`.

All clamav results are logged, any infected files or other errors are logged to the error.log.

Every hour the module checks if it can reach `clamd` using the configured settings. It will log an error if `clamd`
can’t be reached, and an info message if it can be reached.
