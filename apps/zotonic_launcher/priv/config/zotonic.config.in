%% This is the global config file for Zotonic.
%%
%% The configurations are for the Zotonic system itself.
%% Site configuration is found in each site's config file.
%% The site config files are in the subdirectories of priv/sites/.
%%
%% To use this configuration file:
%% 0. Do NOT modify 'config.in', but change the file called 'config',
%%    which is a copy of config.in.
%% 1. Stop Zotonic
%% 2. Change (and uncomment) any setting you want to modify, in the file 'config'
%% 3. Start Zotonic again.
%%
%% Rarely used configurations are commented out, change at your own risk.
%% The given values are the defaults for the options.
%%
%% Be careful with the comma after each option, exclude it after the last option.
