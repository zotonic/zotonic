%% @doc Erlang file monitoring service
%%
%% The behaviour of this service is inspired by the open source FAM
%% daemon ([http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/]). It allows file system
%% paths to be monitored, so that a message will be sent to the client
%% process whenever a status change is detected. Currently, the only
%% supported method of detection is by regular polling by the server.
%% While it is not optimal, polling has less overhead than might be
%% expected, and is portable across platforms. The polling interval can
%% be adjusted; by default the server polls all monitored paths every 5
%% seconds. Recursive (automatic) monitoring is supported. The server
%% keeps track of its client processes, and removes all their monitors
%% if they should die.
%%
%% == Event messages ==
%%
%% When a new monitor is set up, or a change is detected, an event
%% message is sent to the client. These have the following general form:
%% <pre>{@type @{file_monitor, Ref::monitor(), Event@}}</pre>
%% where `Ref' is the monitor reference returned when the monitor was
%% set up, and `Event' is one of the following:
%% <ul>
%%  <li>{@type @{found, Path::binary(), Type, Info::#file_info@{@},
%%                      Entries::[{added|deleted, Name::binary()@}]@}}</li>
%%  <li>{@type @{changed, Path::binary(), Type, Info::#file_info@{@},
%%                      Entries::[{added|deleted, Name::binary()@}]@}}</li>
%%  <li>{@type @{error, Path::binary(), Type, PosixError::atom()@}}</li>
%% </ul>
%% where `Path' is the watched path (as a binary), `Type' is the type of
%% monitoring being performed (either `file' or `directory'), `Info' is
%% a `file_info' record as defined in `kernel/include/file.hrl', and
%% `Entries' is a list of tuples `{added, binary()}' and `{deleted,
%% binary()}' describing changes to the directory entries if `Type' is
%% `directory', otherwise this is always the empty list. For a `found'
%% event, all entries are `{added, Name}'.
%%
%% A `found' event is sent when a monitor is initially set up, if the
%% path can be read. After that, whenever a change in status is
%% detected, a `changed' event is sent. If the file does not exist or
%% could for some other reason not be accessed, an `error' event is sent
%% (both initially and for subsequent changes). In other words, the
%% first event for a path is always either `found' or `error', and later
%% events are either `changed' or `error'.
%%
%% === Detection of file type changes ===
%%
%% If the object found at a path changes type in the interval between
%% two polls, for example if a directory is replaced by a file with the
%% same name, or vice versa, the file monitor server will detect this
%% and dispatch an `enoent' error event before the new status event. A
%% client can thus rely on always seeing the old file disappear before
%% any change that reports a different file type.
%%
%% == Monitoring types ==
%%
%% There are two ways in which a path can be monitored: as a `file',
%% meaning that we are interested only in the object found at that path,
%% or as a `directory', meaning that we expect the path to point to a
%% directory, and we are also interested in the list of entries of that
%% directory.
%%
%% If a path is monitored as a directory, and the object at the path
%% exists but is not a directory, an `enotdir' error event will be
%% generated. An existing directory can however both be monitored as a
%% directory and as a file - the difference is that in the latter case,
%% the reported list of entries will always be empty.
%%
%% == Automatic (recursive) monitoring ==
%%
%% Automatic monitoring (automonitoring for short) can be used to watch
%% a single file of any type, or a whole directory tree. The monitoring
%% type (`file' or `directory') used for any path is based on the actual
%% type of object found at the path (`directory' if the object is a
%% readable directory, and `file' otherwise). If the object is replaced
%% by another of different type, the monitoring type will change
%% automatically.
%%
%% When a directory becomes automonitored, all of its entries will also
%% be automatically monitored, recursively. As entries are created or
%% deleted in an automonitored directory, they will be dynamically added
%% or removed, respectively, from being monitored. The root path used to
%% create the automonitor will however always remain monitored (even if
%% the object temporarily or permanently disappears) until the server is
%% told to delete the monitor.
%%
%% The event messages sent to the client are the same as if manual
%% monitoring was done. A newly discovered path will be reported by a
%% `found' (or possibly, by an `error' event), and subsequent changes on
%% that path are reported by `changed' and `error' events. If the
%% monitoring type is changed, a new `found' event is sent, and so on.

%% Handling of auto-monitoring events
%%
%% - If a new entry of an automonitored directory is discovered, make it
%%   too automonitored (this does recursive monitoring by definition).
%%
%% - If an entry is deleted from an automonitored directory, remove any
%%   automonitor from it and its subdirectories recursively. Note that
%%   by definition, this will never auto-remove the top automonitored
%%   directory.
%%
%% - Because of the special status of the top directory (the path given
%%   to automonitor), we do not allow the user to add/remove paths to an
%%   existing automonitor or pass a user-specified reference.
%%
%% - Note that to be able to demonitor directories recursively, we must
%%   track the automonitored directory entries for each directory and
%%   monitor pair (since the directory itself can no longer be read,
%%   there is no other way we can know which subentries to demonitor).
%%
%% - An automonitored non-directory that changes type to directory, or
%%   vice versa, should should cause recreation of the monitor to match
%%   the new type.
%%
%% - Errors on automonitored files are assumed to be intermittent, i.e.,
%%   not even enoent should in itself cause demonitoring - that is done
%%   only if the containing directory reports that the file is removed.
%%
%% - Errors on automonitored directories cause immediate demonitoring of
%%   the entries of the directory, but not the directory itself.

%% we did not see all the additions/deletions that were made that second
%% - and in that case, we might not detect those changes until the
%% timestamp changes again (maybe never). (This really happens - in
%% particular in test suites...) But we cannot use the system clock for
%% comparisons, because the file system might be on another clock (or
%% another time zone setting), and read-access timestamps are also not
%% reliable (not consistently updated on all platforms and not at all on
%% some file systems). Therefore we do our own internal approximation of
%% passed time (#state.time), based on the refresh cycle.
%% Furthermore, we should make sure that the timestamps we use are
%% always from after the directory was last listed, so that we never
%% report an added entry that was actually created later than the
%% directory timestamp.
