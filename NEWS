Welcome to Zotonic!

Release 0.9.0, not yet released
-------------------------------

* New core features:

Ability to make mobile sites using automatic user agent classification
and template selection based on the detected user agent.

All base HTML has moved to use the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework
instead of Atatonic. This includes the admin (which got a new design)
and the base templates for the skeleton sites. All Atatonic CSS files
have been removed from Zotonic. Cufon is also no longer included.

Modules can now implement their own URL dispatch mechanisms through
#dispatch{} notifications. They are triggered when the regular
dispatch rules do not match.

* New tags/changed tags

{% javascript %}...{% endjavascript %}
Adds javascript that will be run after jQuery has been initialized.
In dynamic content it will run after the DOM has been updated with the
template where the javascript was defined.

{% image %} new attribute: imageclass
Image classes are defined using property files in the template 
directory. Which image class definition is chosen depends on the 
user agent classification.


* Modules

mod_geomap
    New module: Provides mapping and geocoding.

mod_comment
    Added the possibility to have comments be moderated before submitting.

* New filters

menu_subtree:
    Finds the menu below a particular resource id.
    Usage:  m.rsc.main_menu.menu|menu_subtree:id


* New scomps

geomap_static:
    Makes the HTML for a static map of a location.
    Uses the OpenStreetMaps tiles.
    Example usage:
        {% geomap_static id=id n=3 %}
    (Show the location of the resource 'id' in a grid of 3x3 tiles).


Release 0.8.0, released on 2012-04-11
-------------------------------------

* New core features:

Module manager: module manager startup stability fixes, module
dependencies and starting/stopping modules in the correct order.

Status site - the site status got a redesign to be more in line with
the current zotonic.com site. It now shows a friendly welcome
message and requires a login to view / manage the running zotonic
sites.

PostgreSQL - we stabilized the pgsql connection pool in the presence
of database connection failures and improvoved query timeout
handling.

The "host" option in a site's config file is now optional. When not
present it will be derived from the site's directory name.


* New / updated modules:

** mod_oembed - Provides an easier way to embed external content into
   your site, using the OEmbed standard.

** mod_translation - added support for RTL languages like Hebrew and
   Arabic in the admin interface. Content pages that are translated in
   multiple languages now have a separate URL for each language
   version.  Translations of the admin interface were added for Irish,
   Spanish, Estonian and Polish.

** mod_mailinglist - Improved the mailinglist interface. It is now much
   easier to track to which list a page has been sent to, to preview
   the mailing and to view and manage bounced emails.

** mod_development - On Linux, development has been made easier by
   integrating inotify. Supports on-the-fly compilation of Erlang
   files, flushing caches, and compiling/minifying
   LESS/SCSS/Coffeescript.

* Other minor features

** New filter: index_of, which gives the index of an item in a list.
** filter_random:random/3 - create random sublist with length l.
** range filter: easily generate lists with integers
** replace_args filter: replace $N in string from a list of replacement values.
** date validator: validate input date against a given date format.

* Development process

The git master branch switched to using git submodules for the most
important external dependencies.

Documentation got updated, most source files now have @doc tags which
are generated and available online at from
http://zotonic.com/documentation


Release 0.7.0, released on 2011-07-28
-------------------------------------

* New core features:

Native SMTP support for sending and receiving e-mails in any Zotonic
site. We integrated Andrew Thompson's gen_smtp library which allows us
to manage outgoing Ã¡nd incoming mails. mod_logging provides a new
email log-view for inspecting what mails go in and out.

A "zotonic" shell command. The "zotonic.sh" shell command has been
replaced by a more generic and more powerful shell command with
support for pluggable subcommands.

Module repository: Zotonic now supports installing system-wide modules
which are not part of the core repository. We have created a place
where externally contributed modules can be linked at
http://modules.zotonic.com/. Modules registered on that site
can be easily installed through the "addsite" subcommand.

The default website has been replaced by the notion of "skeleton"
sites. The "zotonic addsite" command lets you create a new Zotonic
website based on one of the (currently two) website templates.


* New modules:

** mod_email_relay
   Relay received e-mails to an user's email address. Serving as an
   example for the SMTP functionality, this module looks up a username
   by the local part of a received e-mail and forwards the mail to the
   mail address the user configured.

** mod_email_receive
   Handle received e-mails, notifies email observers depending on a
   stored mapping of recipient addresses.

** mod_import_csv
   Fairly generic module for importing CSV files, updating or creating
   new content on the fly.

** mod_import_wordpress
   Basic import module for Wordpress WXR file format, allowing you to
   migrate a Wordpress blog into Zotonic.


** Discontinued modules

To make Zotonic more lightweight and remove some of the build
dependencies, some infrequently used modules have been removed from
the core and moved to their own repository, at
http://code.google.com/p/zotonic-modules/.  These modules are
mod_search_solr, mod_pubsub, mod_slideshow, mod_broadcast,
mod_imageclipper, mod_admin_event and mod_calendar. They can still be
easily installed with the help of the "zotonic installmodule"
command. The mod_emailer module (and its esmtp library) has been
removed in favor of the native SMTP sending/receiving capabilities.

Each module now also can have its own dependencies by including a
"deps" subfolder in the module. This is used for example in the
mod_pubsub external module which has the exmpp library as a dependency.


* Other minor features

** to_json filter for representing template values as JSON objects

** split filter for splitting a string

** slice filter for manipulating lists

** Added {% raw %}..{% endraw %} support for representing literal code blocks.

** erlydtl: Added possibility to define atoms using backquoted strings.

** admin templates are reorganized, allowing to write admin customizations with less code

** translations of the admin updated and more translations added


* Bugfixes

stable and this release aims to be a good step towards the 1.0.

** z_logger 
   A new subsystem for the low-level logging and tracing of requests.
   This module should be used to log lower level events during
   development time. Higher-level log messages (e.g. events by
   Zotonic modules) are still handled by 'mod_logging'.

** multilingual content
   Every resource can have be translated in as many languages as you
   like. The admin has gotten an interface to provide the editing of
   the multiple language versions. Available languages are fully
   dynamically configurable.

Release 0.5.0, released on 2010-10-03
-------------------------------------

* New features:

** Simpler module system 
   Modules are simpler, do not have to be a fullblown
   gen_server. Registering z_notifier for modules is made more simpler
   by using erlang's introspection on modules.

** i18n support through gettext
   Gettext .po and .pot file support for translations. Templates can
   be translated per module.  Pot files are automatically generated
   from the templates.

** Pluggable Access Control system
   The new ACL structure works through pluggable ACL modules. Two ACL
   modules are included as examples.  mod_acl_adminonly, where all
   users are admins, and mod_acl_simple_roles, which implements a
   simple role based ACL system.

** Authentication can now be customized and extended.  
   mod_authentication is the basic module used for
   authentication. This module can be extended. The mod_facebook is an
   (incomplete) example of such an extender. mod_authentication
   implements the username/password authentication, including logon
   and logoff.  It also supports 'password forgotten' e-mails.

** User signup
   Non admin users can sign up using the mod_signup. This module works
   in harmony with the authentication module and authentication
   extenders.

** New OTP supervisor hierarchy. 
   The PostgreSQL connection pool is now part of the individual
   sites. Sites are more isolated and can be individually started,
   restarted or stopped. It is possible to add and remove sites
   without restarting Zotonic.  Modules are now isolated and the
   running status of a module is displayed in the admin's module
   overview.

** A status overview site, zotonic_status.  
   zotonic_status shows the running status of all sites.  When logged
   in, the user can start/stop/restart sites using his browser.  It is
   also possible to do 'hg pull' updates of sites that contain a
   mercurial repo.

** New ErlyDTL tags: {% inherit %}, {% overrule %}

** New ErlyDTL support for multiple argument {% with %}: {%  with a,b as c,d %}

** New ErlyDTL support for filters with multiple parameters.

** New ErlyDTL test set, including regression tests.

** New ErlyDTL filters
   group_by_title_firstchar, is_visible, pprint, urlize, without_embedded_media.

** Media preview enhancements
   {% image %} now supports the the following new arguments:
   
   'extent' - create a larger image then the original not by scaling
   up but by adding a border to the image.
   
   'removebg' - removes the image's
   background. It accepts an optional fuzziness parameter (range
   0..100).

   'upscale' - Forces a small image to scale up to the requested
   dimensions.

** Extended support for Websocket connections. 
   The two newest protocols, as used by Chrome and Safari, are
   supported.

** mod_development improvements
   It now supports turning on or off the concatenation of {% lib %}
   includes as one file or separate files, and can give a live trace
   of translated templates, showing clearly the template inheritance
   and selections.

** mod_menu improvements
   It implements the menu now as a template, easing your own menu implementation.

** mod_emailer improvements
   It can now inline images into the e-mails

** New: mod_slideshow 
   It can make a slideshow of any collection, you can add your own slide templates.

** New: mod_contact
   Simple contact form which gets sent over e-mail

** New: mod_facebook
   Facebook logon

** New: mod_imageclipper
   A simple javascript image-clipper bookmarklet for grabbing images
   from other websites.
