E-mail handling
===============

Configuration
-------------

Any Zotonic system is capable of sending and receiving e-mail messages
over SMTP.

Zotonic implements a mailing system for sending text and HTML messages
to one or more recipients.

Out of the box, e-mail sending should "just work".

port. Spam filtering is done by checking DNSBL (DNS Block List) servers and
optionally using Spamassassin.

The sender’s domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recipients of e-mail want a valid sender’s address on the
envelope. This section describes how to set your e-mail bounce/sender
domain and fixing domain errors when sending e-mail.

You have to think of e-mail as normal snail mail. There is a message
and an envelope.

The ``email_from`` is the address that is written on the `message`.
It could be anything, and is generally not used when delivering your
mail. Just like with snail mail, the postman only looks on the
`envelope`, not on the message.

The address on the envelope is the most important address. It is where
your e-mail is returned to when the message can‘t be delivered (so
called bounces). Often it is also checked for validity when the e-mail
is delivered at a SMTP server.

You need a valid domain for this envelope sender address. The part
before the ``@`` is generated by Zotonic and is used for identifying
the original message and recipient when the message bounces.

If the generated part is not acceptable then you can force an envelope
address by setting the ``smtp_bounce_email_override`` option. Setting the
bounce/envelop address manually disables Zotonic’s build-in handling of
bounces that happen *after* the e-mail was accepted for delivery by
the remote SMTP host.

The bounce e-mail address can also be set on a per-site basis using the
``site.bounce_email_override`` configuration. See the site specific
settings table above.


How does Zotonic know the domain?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It checks in order:

- site’s config: ``bounce_email_override`` (you can also set this with the admin config as site.bounce_email_override)
- global ``~/.zotonic/zotonic.config``: ``smtp_bounce_domain`` setting
- site’s config: ``smtphost``
- site’s config: ``hostname``

Any *bounce_email_override* configuration must be a complete email address.
For example: ``bounces@example.org``

If no *bounce_email_override* is used then the part before the ``@`` is
generated by Zotonic itself, for administration and detection of bounces.
A typical sender address on the envelope looks like:
``noreply+mlcm6godbz2cchtgdvom@example.org``

Sending E-mail
--------------

Once configured, you can use the following Erlang commands to send
e-mail from Zotonic code:

+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|Command                  |Explanation                                       |
+=========================+==================================================+
|``z_email:send_admin/3`` |Sends a quick e-mail to the site                  |
|                         |administrator. Handy to notice the site admin that|
|                         |something is wrong, a job has finished, etc... The|
|                         |e-mail that is used is the admin_email address    |
|                         |that is specified in the site’s config file.      |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|``z_email:send/4``       |Sends a text message with a subject to a specified|
|                         |recipient.                                        |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|``z_email:send_render/4``|Renders a template and sends it as a HTML message |
|                         |to a specified recipient.                         |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
|``z_email:send/2``       |Sends an email defined by a ``#email{}`` record.  |
+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

Send e-mail from a template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, create a :ref:`template <guide-templates>` for the e-mail. Just like
normal templates, it can contain :ref:`variables <template-variables>`. The
``<title>`` tag becomes the e-mail’s subject:

.. code-block:: django
    :caption: email.tpl

    <html>
        <head>
            <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
            <title>An e-mail from {{ sender_name }} at {{ m.site.title }}</title>
        </head>

        <body>
            Hello {{ id.name_first }},

            Hope you’re doing fine!

            Cheers,

            {{ sender_name }}
        </body>
    </html>

To include inline images, just add an ``<img>`` tag:

.. code-block:: django
    :caption: email.tpl

    …
        <body>
            <img src="http://yoursite.com/logo.png">
        </body>
    …

Use the :ref:`image tag <tag-image>` to include a
:ref:`media depiction <guide-media>`:

.. code-block:: django
    :caption: email.tpl

    …
        <body>
            {% image id.depiction %}
        </body>
    …

After you’ve created the template, you can send the e-mail. You can provide
the template variables (we had ``id`` and ``sender_name`` in the template) as
``vars``::

    -include_lib("zotonic_core/include/zotonic.hrl").

    some_function(SomeId, Sender, Context) ->
        %% Create an e-mail record
        Email = #email{
            to = "someone@somewhere.com,
            vars = [
                {id, SomeId},
                {sender_name, Sender}
            ],
            html_tpl = "email.tpl"
        },

        %% And send the e-mail
        z_email:send(Email, Context).

Send e-mail to the admin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``z_email:send_admin/3`` command actually looks in three different
places for determining the admin e-mail address: the config key
``zotonic.admin_email``, then the ``site.admin_email`` key, and
finally the `email` property of the admin user (user with id 1).

If no admin email address is found then the address ``wwwadmin@example.com``
is used, where ``example.com`` will be your site’s hostname.

Receiving E-mail
----------------

In its default configuration, Zotonic starts an SMTP server on port
2525 for receiving e-mail messages. You can write your own code to
decide what happens if somebody sends e-mail to the system, by
implementing the ``email_received`` notification (see below).

The SMTP server is also used to receive bounce messages from other
servers, when sending of a message has failed. :ref:`mod_mailinglist`
uses this functionality to automatically deactivate invalid e-mail
addresses.

Configuring incoming E-mail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To send messages to Zotonic, the domain part of the e-mail address
should have an A or MX record which points to the server where Zotonic
is able to receive on port 25. This means that you have to add a
firewall rule to redirect port 25 to 2525.

If you were to set up e-mail receiving for a site called
``example.com``, you could test if this is working by using the `netcat`
program, like this::

  nc example.com 25

Then, you should be greeted by Zotonic in the following way::

  220 example.com ESMTP Zotonic 0.13.0

Press ctrl-c to exit.

Handling incoming E-mail
""""""""""""""""""""""""

When receiving an e-mail message, Zotonic looks at the domain part of
the e-mail address to determine which :term:`Zotonic site` is
configured to handle this message. It looks at the ``host`` and
``hostalias`` fields in the site’s config file to match the recipient
domain.

If no site matches the e-mails domain, the message is dropped, and a
warning logged.

For handling incoming messages in your site, you need a hook in your
site module to do something with the received messages, implementing
the ``email_receive`` notification.

.. highlight:: erlang

The code in your module looks like this::

  observe_email_received(E, _C) ->
      lager:warning("Email from: ~p: ~p", [E#email_received.from,
                                           E#email_received.email#email.subject]),
      ok.

Export this function and then restart your site. Now, send an e-mail
message to any address ``@example.com``, and notice that it arrives in
Zotonic::

  (zotonic001@host.local)9> 20:57:54.174 [warning] Email from: <<"arjan@miraclethings.nl">>: <<"Hello!">>

Feedback
^^^^^^^^

If you need feedback on messages that have been sent, enable
:ref:`mod_logging` which provides an overview of sent/received and
bounced messages.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Check in the admin the log and smtp log. If a message bounces back
to the Zotonic SMTP server, you will see errors there. A typical error
looks like this::

  SMTP: bounce: 504 5.5.2 <noreply+mlcm6godbz2cchtgdvom@oeps>: Sender address rejected: need fully-qualified address To: piet@example.com (1234) From: <noreply+mlcm6godbz2cchtgdvom@oeps>
