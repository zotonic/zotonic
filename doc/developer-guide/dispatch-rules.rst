Dispatch rules
==============

Dispatch rules (also known as routes) map URLs to
:ref:`controllers <guide-controllers>`, and the other way around.

A dispatch rule contains a pattern that is matched against the `path`
of an incoming request URL. They are also used for the reverse action
of generating request URLs in Zotonic.

When an URL is requested by the web browser, the dispatch system looks
at that URL and matches it agains all dispatch rules that are
loaded. Based on the match, it will call a :ref:`controller <controllers>` to handle the request.

.. _defining-dispatch-rules:

Defining dispatch rules
-----------------------

Dispatch rules are defined in a `dispatch` file. The dispatch file
must be placed inside the ``dispatch/`` directory of a module or your
site.

A module or site can have multiple dispatch files, and they can have
`any` filename. Nota bene: the file may not have the extension
“.erl”. Otherwise it will be compiled by the Emakefile, which will
result in errors as a dispatch file is not a valid Erlang module.

The content of a dispatch file is an Erlang list of dispatch rules.

An example ``dispatch`` file looks like this::

    %% Example dispatch rules
    [
        {home,      [],                         controller_page,  [ {template, "home.tpl"}, {id, page_home} ]},
        {features,  ["features"],               controller_page,  [ {template, "features.tpl"}, {id, page_features} ]},
        {collection,["collection", id, slug],   controller_page,  [ {template, "collection.tpl"} ]},
        {category,  ["category", id, slug],     controller_page,  [ {template, "category.tpl"} ]},
        {documentation, ["documentation", id, slug], controller_page, [ {template, "documentation.tpl"} ]}
    ].

The module indexer will load all dispatch files. They can be reloaded
with the “rescan” button in the admin modules page. Illegal dispatch
files are skipped, showing an error message in the Zotonic shell.

When your dispatch rules don't work, check first if there are any
typos, then check if your dispatch rules are not overruled by a module
that loads earlier. Modules are loaded on priority first, then on
module name.


Anatomy of a dispatch rule
--------------------------

A single dispatch rule looks like::

  {page, ["page", id], controller_page, [{some_option,true}]}

Where the elements are:

1. a name identifying the dispatch rule (used by {% :ref:`tag-url` %})
2. the path matching the request URL's path
3. the name of the controller (:ref:`controller-page` in this example)
4. a property list with optional arguments to the controller
   module. Refer to the documentation for respective controller for
   available options.

.. seealso:: The full list of available :ref:`controllers`.

Dispatch rule naming
....................

Zotonic extends Basho’s Webmachine by allowing (or actually,
`requiring`) dispatch rules to be named. The name is the first element
of the dispatch rule tuple, and consists of a simple atom. The
``z_dispatcher:url_for`` function takes a name and creates the URL for
it. This allows the developer to not hardcode the URLs everywhere, but
use these symbolic names instead.

Dispatch rule names do not have to be unique: if multiple rules with
the same name exist, it will look at the first rule that matches the
given name and the optional extra arguments that were given.

Say I have these rules::

  {rulename, ["foo", "bar"], controller_template, [{template, "foo.tpl"}]},
  {rulename, ["foo", var], controller_template, [{template, "foo.tpl"}]},

Then when I create a URL like this::

  {% url rulename %}

It will match the first rule (rendering the url ``/foo/bar``) because
no arguments were given. However when I add an argument::

  {% url rulename var=1 %}

It will render the URL ``/foo/1``, matching the second dispatch rule
and adding the argument in the creation of the URL.

In a template the value of the argument can be retrieved with the `q` variable.
In the example where the atom `var` is used::

  {{ q.var }}

Note that any `extra` arguments that are given, are added as query-string parameters::

  {% url rulename var=1 x="hello" %}

Will result in the URL ``/foo/1?x=hello``.


URL match pattern
.................

Every element in the URL pattern list matches to a “directory level”
in the request URL. In the example, the pattern will match a URL like
"page/1234" but not “pages/1234” and also not “page/1234/x”.

The possible path elements are:

- Strings: fixed parts that must match with the request url
- atoms: bind to the text at that position
-  '*': a special atom binding to the remaining part of the request URL, this must be the last element of the path

URL matching using regular expressions
......................................

Some developers need very particular control of dispatch in order for
their applications to function as they want them to.

Say you want to only accept numerical arguments as an id in::

  {foo, ["foo", id], controller_foo, []}

The you can use a dispatch rule with a regular expression test::

  {foo, ["foo", {id, "^[0-9]+$"}], controller_foo, []}

or, you can specify http://erldocs.com/R14B02/stdlib/re.html?i=14&search=re:#run/3 some extra options::

  {foo, ["foo", {id, "1?2?", [notempty]}], controller_foo, []}

(In this case, the id must contain a 1 or a 2, amongst any other characters)


URL matching using callback modules
...................................

When all else fails, there is another option when you are, really,
really, desperate for a specific check.  You can call a module::

  {foo, ["foo", {id, {foo_module, foo_check}}], controller_foo, []}

Though note that this is (currently) an extremely expensive operation,
because it is called in the ``z_sites_dispatcher`` gen_server which
handles the matching of all incoming requests for all sites in one
single process.

When matching against "foo/bar", the module is called as::

  foo_module:foo_check("bar", Context).


Dispatch rule troubleshoooting
------------------------------

**Check the Syntax:** Load your dispatch file in from the EShell with
file:consult/1 and see if it returns errors.

**Dispatch Rules are Order-sensitive:** Dispatch rules are processed
top-to-bottom in the file.  Are any rules above your rule capturing
the cases you are trying to match.  If so, move your rule up, but bear
in mind that you don't want to break those rules either.

**View which values are passed to the template** using tag `debug`:

  {% debug %}


.. _guide-dispatch-rewriting:

URL rewriting
-------------

Before URLs are matched, they first can be `rewritten` to match
something else. This is a powerful mechanism that allows you do
anything you like with URLs.

The URL rewriting mechanism allows one to set extra context variables
or change the (internal) URL so different dispatch rules get
triggered.


:ref:`mod_translation` uses this mechanism to prefix each URL with the
language code of the currently selected language.

.. todo:: document this fully, using mod_translation example


Domain-dependent language selection
...................................

An application of URL rewriting allows you to set the Zotonic language based on the domain that is being requested on your site. To set up domain-based language detection using
the following code snippet::

  observe_dispatch_rewrite(#dispatch_rewrite{host=Host}, {Parts, Args}, _Context) ->
      Language = case Host of
                     "example.nl" -> nl;
                     "example.de" -> de;
                     _ -> en  %% default language
                 end,
      {Parts, [{z_language, Language}|Args]}.

This leaves the request URI intact (the `Parts` variable), but injects
the `z_language` variable into the request context, this overriding
the language selection.

For this setup to work, this requires you to have the ``{redirect,
false}`` option in your site, and the appropriate ``hostalias``
directives for each host. See :ref:`guide-site-anatomy` for more
details on this.


Unmatched hosts/domains
-----------------------

The dispatcher finds the correct site based on the ``Host`` in the request.
If no site can be found then the dispatcher will first check all enabled sites with
a ``#dispatch_host`` notification to see if any site has a known redirect.

If this fails then the dispatcher will select a default site (usually ``zotonic_status``)
to handle the request.

If no site is running then a bare bones `404 Not Found` page will be shown.

See :ref:`mod_custom_redirect` for redirecting unknown domains.


Unmatched paths
---------------

If the dispatcher can’t find a match a dispatch rule against the request path then
it will check the site’s modules using a ``#dispatch`` notification.

The module :ref:`mod_base` will check the request path against the ``page_path`` property of all resources.
After that the module :ref:`mod_custom_redirect` will check the configured redirect locations.


Dispatch rule BNF
-----------------

A dispatch rule is built up as follows::

  {RuleName, UrlPattern, ControllerModule, ControllerArgs}
  RuleName = atom()
  PathSpec = [PathSegmentSpec]
  PathSegmentSpec = StaticMatch | Wildcard | Variable
  StaticMatch = string()
  Wildcard = '*'
  PathVariable = atom() | {atom(), RegExp} | {atom{}, RegExp, ReOptions}
  RegExp = string()
  ReOptions = [term()]
  ResourceModule = atom()
  ResourceArgs = [{Key,Value}]

All `PathVariables` in the matching rule are made available to the
resource through ``z_context``. The `ResourceArgs` proplist is passed
to ``ControllerModule:init/1``.

`PathVariables` are part of the request-scope configuration of
`ControllerModule` . Things like the ID, name or category of a page being
requested can be gathered effectively here. Judicious use of
PathVariables can substantially reduce the number of dispatch rules
while making them easier to read.

`ControllerArgs` is the rule-scope configuration of
ControllerModule. It makes it possible to reuse a well-designed
resource module in many dispatch rules with different
needs. ControllerArgs is effective for establishing implementation
details like the template to be used, whether or not to do caching and
where to load static resources from.

Zotonic dispatch rules are identical to Webmachine’s with the addition
of RuleName. Webmachine’s dispatch rules are described in detail at
http://webmachine.basho.com/dispatcher.html .
