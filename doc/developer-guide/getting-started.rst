Getting Started
===============

You have two options for running Zotonic: to get started quickly, start our
Zotonic container. Or you can install Zotonic on your computer.

Docker
------

First `download and install Docker`_ . Then start Zotonic with a single
command::

    $ docker run -v `pwd`:/opt/zotonic/user/sites -p 8443:8443 zotonic/zotonic-heavy

Docker will download and boot the container. Zotonic will be available on port
8443 on your machine. So, after Docker has booted, open your browser and go to
https://localhost:8443 to view the Zotonic Status page. If you wish to quit
the container, press Ctrl+C.

You can now move on to :ref:`creating your first site <guide-create-site>`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`guide-docker` for more information on our images.

.. _guide-installation:

Installation
------------

If you don’t like Docker, or you like to do things yourself, you can always
install Zotonic on your computer yourself.

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

First prepare your system for running Zotonic. Zotonic needs:

* Erlang 18 or higher
* PostgreSQL 8.4 or higher
* ImageMagick 6.5 or higher for image resizing
* Git for pulling in external dependencies

.. seealso::
    a more extensive discussion of
    :ref:`all requirements <installation-preinstall>`

Linux
"""""

For instance on Debian you can install the dependencies by running::

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential git erlang imagemagick postgresql

macOS X
"""""""

Install Homebrew_, then run::

    $ brew install erlang git imagemagick postgresql

.. _Homebrew: http://brew.sh

On Windows
""""""""""

Currently, Zotonic is not officially supported on the Windows
platform. However, the main dependencies Erlang, PostgreSQL and
ImageMagick do work on Windows, so, if you’re adventurous, it should
be possible to get it running.

We have included user-contributed ``start.cmd`` and ``build.cmd``
batch-scripts which used to work on Windows, but have not been kept
up-to-date with recent changes. Expect some major tweaking to get this
back on track.

Getting Zotonic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download the latest Zotonic release ZIP file from the `GitHub releases page`_. For
   instance:

   .. parsed-literal::
    $ wget \https://github.com/zotonic/zotonic/archive/|release|.zip

   Then unzip the file and rename the directory:

   .. parsed-literal::
    $ unzip |release|.zip
    $ mv zotonic-|release| zotonic

   Alternatively, clone the latest development version using Git::

    $ git clone https://github.com/zotonic/zotonic.git

2. You then need to compile the Zotonic sources::

    $ cd zotonic
    $ make

3. Then start Zotonic in debug mode::

    $ bin/zotonic debug

4. Now point your browser to: https://localhost:8443/.  You should see
   a welcome message, ‘Powered by Zotonic’. This is the so-called
   :ref:`status website <ref-status-site>`. So far, so good! Now it's
   time to :ref:`create your first site <guide-create-site>`.

Next steps
----------

* :ref:`Create your first site <guide-create-site>`.
* Log in to the :ref:`status site <ref-status-site>`.
* If something goes wrong, read the
  :ref:`troubleshooting reference <ref-troubleshooting-installation>`.
* Read more about Zotonic :ref:`configuration <guide-configuration>`.
