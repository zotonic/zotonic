The Status site
===============

The Zotonic "status" site is the first thing you see once you have
installed Zotonic, when you do not have any sites configured yet. This
is what it looks like:

.. image:: /img/zotonic_status_login.png

This site is also the `fallback` site for Zotonic.

Since Zotonic supports virtual hosting, it uses the HTTP ``Host:``
parameter to see which site should be served at which URL. If it does
not find a ``Host:`` header, or if the host header does not correspond
to any known Zotonic site, it shows the ``zotonic_status`` site
instead.


Logging in
----------

Upon first visit, the site shows a friendly message, which tells
visitors that the site they are looking at has probably not been
configured correctly yet.

Pressing the ``Manage this server`` button will bring up the login
dialog.

The username for the status site is ``wwwadmin``. The password is
automatically generated and stored in ``~/.zotonic/[release]/zotonic.config``,
where ``[release]`` is the Zotonic release number, like ``1.0``.

When logged in to the Zotonic status site, you can manage the running
sites on the system: starting, stopping and upgrading them.

The "update" buttons only appear when the site (or Zotonic itself) is
under Mercurial or Git revision control. These buttons do a "pull"
from the repository and then rebuild the system.


Getting the global sites status
-------------------------------

The Zotonic status site exposes an API service to check whether all
Zotonic sites are running::

    curl -k 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/api/model/zotonic_status/get/check'

The option ``-k`` was used because the status site is using a self-signed
certificate.

If all sites are running, it returns::

    {"result":"ok","status":"ok"}

If one or more sites are failing then it returns::

    {"error":"fail","message":"Not all sites are running.","status":"error"}


``"Running"`` means that a siteâ€™s status is not ``"retrying"`` or ``"failed"``;
it ignores sites that are manually stopped or disabled.

This API service can be plugged in to a service like
https://www.pingdom.com/ to monitor the availability of all hosted sites
at once.

Restarting sites
----------------

Alternatively, from the :ref:`Zotonic shell <guide-cli-shell>`::

    z_sites_manager:restart(yoursitename).
