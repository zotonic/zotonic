Browser/server interaction
==========================

There are multiple ways to set up interaction between server-side Zotonic code
and client-side JavaScript.

If you want to initiate the interaction in the client (browser)

1. publish/subscribe.
2. API methods
3. Wires
4. Notifications
5. Transport (deprecated)


Publish/subscribe (MQTT)
------------------------

The preferred transport is using publish and subscribe with MQTT topics.
Message that are published on the bridge topics are relayed between the server
and the browser (and vice versa).

See :ref:`mod_mqtt` for more information.

An example of MQTT PubSub usage is the custom tag :ref:`scomp-live`.


API Methods
-----------

All model interfaces ``m_get``, ``m_post``, and ``m_delete`` are
directly exposed as JSON APIs.

For example, the ``m_get`` call for the Erlang file ``m_mymodel.erl``
is available via a HTTP ``GET`` on the path: ``/api/model/mymodel/get/...``

Similar for the ``POST`` and ``DELETE`` HTTP methods.


.. _guide-named-wire:

Wires
-----

This is part of :ref:`mod_wires` and is the older method of transporting data
between the server and the browser.

It is fully functional and the *admin* interface is using these methods.

If you creating a new site then it is advised to start using the
MQTT topics and isolate the places where you are using wires, so that these
can be replaced in due time.


Wired events
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, define a named action:

.. code-block:: django

    {% wire name="test" action={growl text="Hello world"} %}

Then, call that action from your JavaScript code:

..  code-block:: javascript

    z_event("test");


Trigger server side notifications from JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trigger an Erlang :ref:`notification <guide-notification>` in Zotonic with the
``z_notify`` JavaScript function:

.. code-block:: javascript

    z_notify("mymessage");

or:

.. code-block:: javascript

    z_notify("mymessage", {foo: bar, who: "world"});

This will trigger a call to::

    z_notifier:first(#postback_notify{message = <<"mymessage">>}, Context)

Which you can handle in any Zotonic module by defining::

    -export([observe_postback_notify/2]).
    observe_postback_notify(#postback_notify{message = <<"mymessage">>}, Context) ->
        Who = z_context:get_q(who, Context),
        z_render:growl(["Hello ", z_html:escape(Who)], Context);
    observe_postback_notify(_, _Context) ->
        undefined.

All arguments are available via the ``z_context:get_q/2`` function (and friends).


.. _guide-transport:


Transport
^^^^^^^^^

Zotonic has a message bus to transport data between server and browser. It
transports structured data in different formats and supports retransmission in
case of lost messages.

Zotonic uses two mechanisms to transport data from the browser to the server:

 * WebSocket with bidirectional transports using :ref:`controller-mqtt_transport`
 * AJAX calls to publish via :ref:`controller-mqtt_transport` to a topic. This is used
   to post forms with files to the server.

The WebSocket connection it used to transport data from the server to the browser.

.. note::

    It is strongly advised to use MQTT topics instead of the ``z_transport`` mechanism.
    See :ref:`mod_mqtt` for more information.


From browser to server
""""""""""""""""""""""

To send a message from the browser to the server:

.. code-block:: javascript

    z_transport("mod_example", "ubf", {hello: "world"});

And then on the server, use Erlang to process the message::

    -module(mod_example).

    -export([event/2]).

    -include_lib("zotonic_core/include/zotonic.hrl").

    event(#z_msg_v1{data=Data}, Context) ->
        io:format("~p", [Data]),
        Context;

This will print on the console::

    [{<<"hello">>,<<"world">>}]


Quality of service
""""""""""""""""""

The message will be sent with a quality of service of 0. That means the browser
will try to send the message, but will not check if it arrived. Alterntively,
you can send with a qos of 1, in that case the browser will wait for an ack,
and if that doesnâ€™t arrive in 30 seconds, then a duplicate message will be
requeued for transport:

.. code-block:: javascript

    z_transport("mod_example", "ubf", {hello: "world"}, {qos: 1});

It is possible to define a callback function that will be called if an ack is
received:

.. code-block:: javascript

    z_transport("mod_example", "ubf", {hello:"world"}, {
        qos: 1,
        ack: function(ackMsg, callOptions) {
            alert(ackMsg);
        }
    });

From server to browser
""""""""""""""""""""""

Sending JavaScript (or other data) from the server to the browser is
straightforward::

    z_transport:page(javascript, <<"alert('Hello World');">>, Context);

This transports the JavaScript to the page associated with ``Context``. This
JavaScript will then be evaluated in the browser.

The default quality of service is 0 (see above); to let the page queue retry
delivering the message it is possible to specify another quality of service::

    z_transport:page(javascript, <<"alert('Hello World');">>, [{qos, 1}], Context);

It is also possible to send a message to all open pages of a session, or to all
sessions of a user::

    z_transport:session(javascript, <<"alert('Hello World');">>, [{qos, 1}], Context);
    z_transport:user(javascript, <<"alert('Hello World');">>, [{qos, 1}], Context);

Or transport to a specific page, session or user, but then you will need to
specify the message and the message-queue::

    Msg = z_transport:msg(session, javascript, <<"alert('Hello World');">>, [{qos, 1}]).
    z_transport:transport_user(Msg, UserId, Context).

The message queue is either ``session`` or ``page``. It defines which queue will
be responsible for resending the message and where the ack message is received.
If ``user`` is specified as queue then it will be replaced by ``session``.
