Release 0.50.0
==============

Welcome to Zotonic 0.50.0, released on June 22, 2019.

Main changes are:

  * Compatible with OTP 21, minimal OTP version is now 18
  * View a log of Javascript UI errors in ``/admin/log/ui`` (disable with ``mod_logging.ui_log_disabled``)
  * Log more events like identity changes and applied rate limit throttling
  * Only the admin can now chnage 2FA settings of the admin
  * In the admin connect dialog a new filter on category is added
  * Fix a problem with password resets on expired passwords
  * Fix a problem with password resets when the new password matches the old one
  * Fix a problem with wrong orientation of portrait video on Linux
  * Accept resource updates with ``dmy`` formatted date values

The ``exometer`` application was wrongly initialized since it was split into ``exometere_core``
and other applications. The default erlang configuraton had an entry for ``exometer``, you
should rename this in your ``erlang.config`` file to ``exometer_core``.
