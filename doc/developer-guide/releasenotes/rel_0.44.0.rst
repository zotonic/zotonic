Release 0.44.0
==============

Welcome to Zotonic 0.44.0, released on 18 January, 2019.

Main changes are:

 * New module ``mod_ratelimit``, which limits authentication requests and password resets
 * Automatic session timeout, configure with ``site.session_expire_inactive`` (default 3600 seconds)
 * See all your active sessions at ``/logon/sessions``
 * Mnesia files are now placed in a directory per node, e.g. ``priv/mnesia/zotonic001@foobar/``

BC breaks
---------

* The password reset dispatch rule was changed. If you override ``email_password_reset.tpl``,
  you now need to pass the username too.

  Before::

    {% url logon_reset secret=secret use_absolute_url %}

  After::

    {% url logon_reset secret=secret u=username use_absolute_url %}

 * The delegate and postbacks for authentication requests has been changed.
   Use now `controller_logon` and check the logon and password reset templates for the
   correct arguments. If you didn't add your own authentication templates then you
   don't need to do anything.
