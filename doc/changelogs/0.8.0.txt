Welcome Zotonic 0.8.0, released on April 11, 2012

These are the changes for Zotonic release 0.8.0. The most important
changes are summarized first, below that is a full "git shortlog" of all
changes since release 0.7.


* New core features:

Module manager: module manager startup stability fixes, module
dependencies and starting/stopping modules in the correct order.

Status site - the site status got a redesign to be more in line with
the current zotonic.com site. It now shows a friendly welcome
message and requires a login to view / manage the running zotonic
sites.

PostgreSQL - we stabilized the pgsql connection pool in the presence
of database connection failures and improvoved query timeout
handling.

The "host" option in a site's config file is now optional. When not
present it will be derived from the site's directory name.


* New / updated modules:

** mod_oembed - Provides an easier way to embed external content into
   your site, using the OEmbed standard.

** mod_translation - added support for RTL languages like Hebrew and
   Arabic in the admin interface. Content pages that are translated in
   multiple languages now have a separate URL for each language
   version.  Translations of the admin interface were added for Irish,
   Spanish, Estonian and Polish.

** mod_mailinglist - Improved the mailinglist interface. It is now much
   easier to track to which list a page has been sent to, to preview
   the mailing and to view and manage bounced emails.

** mod_development - On Linux, development has been made easier by
   integrating inotify. Supports on-the-fly compilation of Erlang
   files, flushing caches, and compiling/minifying
   LESS/SCSS/Coffeescript.

* Other minor features

** New filter: index_of, which gives the index of an item in a list.
** filter_random:random/3 - create random sublist with length l.
** range filter: easily generate lists with integers


* Development process

The git master branch switched to using git submodules for the most
important external dependencies.

Documentation got updated, most source files now have @doc tags which
are generated and available online at from
http://zotonic.com/documentation
