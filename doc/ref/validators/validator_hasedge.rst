A :ref:`validator <guide-validators>` to check if a resource has a certain number
of edges with a predicate.

An example of its usage is an edit form where the article needs between 1 and 5 keywords and an author.

It can be attached to any (hidden) input field or the form itself.

An example to check the number of keywords attached to a resource::

    <div class="form-group"> <!-- form-group has class "has-error" if validation fails -->
        <input type="hidden" id="check-author" value="author">
        {% validate id="check-author"
                    type={hasedge id=id minimum=1}
                    only_on_submit
        %}
        <p class="if-field-invalid" style="display: none">{_ You must have at least one author. _}</p>
        <p class="if-field-valid" style="display: none">{_ Great, you added at least one author. _}</p>
    </div>

On form submit the check will be done. And either of the two messages will be shown.
The predicate to be checked is the value of the hidden input element.

The hidden input element is not submitted as it doesnâ€™t have a name.
