A :ref:`validator <guide-validators>` to check whether a password conforms to the
password secutiry requirements.

It can be attached to a password entry field used to set a new password::

    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" autocomplete="new-password" value="">
    {% validate id="password"
                type={acceptable_password}
                only_on_blur
    %}

The password will be sent to the server when the user leaves the password field.

The server will then check for:

 * minimum password length, as configured in ``mod_authentication.password_min_length`` (defaults to 8)
 * matching a regular expression with criteria, as configured in ``mod_authentication.password_min_length``
 * check if the password does not appear in a leak, unless ``mod_authentication.password_disable_leak_check`` is set (this uses the service at `Have I Been Pwned <https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords>`_)

You can pass a ``failure_message``::

    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" autocomplete="new-password" value="">
    {% validate id="password"
                type={acceptable_password
                    failure_message=_"Your new password it too short or not strong enough"
                }
                only_on_blur
    %}
