Live updating templates connected to :ref:`MQTT topics <mod_mqtt>`.

This tag renders templates that are automatically re-rendered after a
publication to an MQTT topic.

.. note::

    This tag is provided by :ref:`mod_mqtt`, which must be enabled.

Example
-------

.. highlight: django

An example of a template showing the newest content of a resource::

    {% live template="_detail.tpl" topic=id id=id %}

This renders the template ``_detail.tpl``. If the resource with id ``id`` is
updated then the template will be replaced with a freshly rendered template.

The tag can subscribe to multiple topics at once.

Add the argument ``catinclude`` to do a :ref:`tag-catinclude` instead of a
normal :ref:`tag-include`. For a catinclude the argument ``id`` must be present::

    {% live template="_detail.tpl" topic=id catinclude id=id %}

.. important::

    By default, the ``{% live %}`` tag will not work for anonymous users because
    they have no access to MQTT topics. To change this, you need to
    :ref:`add an acl_is_allowed observer <mqtt-access-control>`.

Live topics
-----------

Any MQTT topic can be used. The topics are interpreted as local to the page.
There are three special topics:

* Use any integer to map to the resourceâ€™s update topic. For example if id is ``1234`` then the topic will be ``~site/rsc/1234``
* Use the tuple ``{object id=...}`` to listen to changes of outgoing connections from a page. An example of a mapped topic is ``~site/rsc/1234/o/+``.
  Use the tuple ``{object id=... predicate=...}`` to listen to changes of a specific predicate of a page. An example of a mapped topic is ``~site/rsc/1234/o/author``
* Use the tuple ``{subject id=... }`` to listen to changes of incoming connections to a page. An example of a mapped topic is ``~site/rsc/1234/s/author``


Live actions
------------

It is possible to wire actions or postbacks to a MQTT topic.

Use the :ref:`wire tag <scomp-wire>` with argument
``type={mqtt topic=... topic=...}`` to connect to one or more MQTT topics:

.. code-block:: django

    {% wire type={mqtt topic="~site/public/hello"} action={growl text="hello"} %}

And in Erlang this will trigger the above *growl*::

    z_mqtt:publish(<<"~site/public/hello">>, <<>>, z_acl:sudo(z:c(mysite))).
