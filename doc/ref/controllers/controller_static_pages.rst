.. include:: meta-static_pages.rst

Serve a static page or pages.

With this controller it is possible to add a folder with static files as a sub-site to your
Zotonic site. Add the folder and all files to a directory in your
template directory or your siteâ€™s directory and define the directory
in a dispatch rule.

Example dispatch rule::

  {oldsite, ["old", '*'], controller_static_pages, [{root, "old_site"}]}

When a file ``a.txt`` is requested this resource will check for
``a.txt`` and ``a.txt.tpl``.  When it finds a ``.tpl`` file then that
file be handled as a template.  All dispatch configuration variables
are available in the template.

Directories will be redirected to the directory name with a ``/``
appended.  The resource serves the file ``index.html`` or
``index.html.tpl`` for the directory contents. If these are not found,
it will give a 404 page, unless the ``allow_directory_index`` option
is set; in which case a directory listing is displayed.

It has the following dispatch options:
