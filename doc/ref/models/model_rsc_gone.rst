This model tracks deleted resources (see :ref:`model-rsc`). Its
primary goal is to be able to determine if a resource never existed,
has been deleted or has been replaced by another resource.

Information kept
----------------

Only very basic information of the deleted resource is kept in the ``rsc_gone``
table. It is enough for referring to a new location, giving correct errors or
to determine who deleted a resource.

It is not enough to undelete a resource. The module :ref:`mod_backup` retains enough
information about past versions to be able to undelete a resource. Currently there
is no support for an undelete.

Properties
----------

Whenever a :ref:`model-rsc` record is deleted some information from
that resource is copied to the ``rsc_gone`` table.

The following properties are saved:
