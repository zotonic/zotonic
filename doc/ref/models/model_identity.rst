The m_identity model manages usernames and other user
identities. :ref:`mod_authentication` uses it to store and check
salted passwords, but also provides a safe storage for user tokens of
any kind, as used by :ref:`mod_facebook`.

Note that a `user` does not have to be of the `person` category per
se, in Zotonic anything can have identities attached to it.

The following m_identity model properties are available in templates:

|        |m.identity[page_id].is_user |             |
