Templates
=========

The templates in Zotonic are based on the Django Template Language
(DTL), using a customized version of the excellent `ErlyDTL
<https://github.com/evanmiller/erlydtl>`_ library. Over the years,
Zotonic's version of ErlyDTL has diverged, adding Zotonic-specific
features and more powerful expression possibilities. However, the main
template syntax remains the same:

The double accolade/brace construct outputs the value of the
variable::

  {{ foo }}

Optionally, you can `pipe` these variables through a so-called filter,
which is applied before output::

  {{ foo|lower }}

Template `tags` allow you to express complex constructs like loops and
branches::

  {% if username == 'Arjan' %} Hi, Arjan {% endif %}
  

Being a web framework, it is of no surprise that templates are one of
the most broad topics in Zotonic. The template manual has therefore
been split up into the following sections, each of which addresses a
specific template-related topic.
