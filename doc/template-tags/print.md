Show the contents of a value expression.

The `{% print %}` tag is used to dump the contents of a variable in a HTML safe way. It is very useful for debugging and inspecting variables during template development.

For example:


```django
{% print value %}
```

When value is `"<b\>Hello</b\> world!"` then the example above returns the output:


```html
<pre>
&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; world!
</pre>
```

It can also print complex values like nested lists and tuples, for which it uses Erlangâ€™s `io_lib:format/2` function.
