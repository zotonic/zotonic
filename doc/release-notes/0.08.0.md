Welcome Zotonic 0.8.0, released on April 11, 2012. These are the changes for Zotonic release 0.8.0. The most important changes are summarized first, below that is a full “git shortlog” of all changes since release 0.7.



New core features
-----------------

Module manager

Module manager startup stability fixes, module dependencies and starting/stopping modules in the correct order.

Status site

The site status got a redesign to be more in line with the current zotonic.com site. It now shows a friendly welcome message and requires a login to view / manage the running zotonic sites.

PostgreSQL

We stabilized the pgsql connection pool in the presence of database connection failures and improvoved query timeout handling.

The “host” option in a site’s config file is now optional. When not present it will be derived from the site’s directory name.



New / updated modules
---------------------

mod\_oembed

Provides an easier way to embed external content into your site, using the OEmbed standard.

mod\_translation

added support for RTL languages like Hebrew and Arabic in the admin interface. Content pages that are translated in multiple languages now have a separate URL for each language version. Translations of the admin interface were added for Irish, Spanish, Estonian and Polish.

mod\_mailinglist

Improved the mailinglist interface. It is now much easier to track to which list a page has been sent to, to preview the mailing and to view and manage bounced emails.

mod\_development

On Linux, development has been made easier by integrating inotify. Supports on-the-fly compilation of Erlang files, flushing caches, and compiling/minifying LESS/SCSS/Coffeescript.



Other minor features
--------------------

New filter: `index_of`, which gives the index of an item in a list.

`filter_random:random/3` - create random sublist with length l.

`range` filter: easily generate lists with integers



Development process
-------------------

The git master branch switched to using git submodules for the most important external dependencies.

Documentation got updated, most source files now have @doc tags which are generated and available online at from <http://zotonic.com/documentation>
