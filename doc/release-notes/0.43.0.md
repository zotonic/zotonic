Welcome to Zotonic 0.43.0, released on 19 December, 2018.

Main changes are:

*   Allowed files in mod\_acl\_user\_groups are now configurable
*   Security fixes for reflected XSS in the admin and skel/blog/archives.tpl
*   Hardened HTTP headers for securing Zotonic sessions and requests
*   mod\_twitter now uses polling for fetching tweets, stopped using deprecated streaming API



Security Advisory
-----------------

If you have a blog site derived from the skel/blog then replace the archives.tpl file in your site with the one provided in priv/skel/blog/archives.tpl



Compatibility
-------------

If you include a page of your site inside a frame on another site, then set the `allow_frame` option on the affected dispatch rule.
