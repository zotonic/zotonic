Welcome to Zotonic 0.57.0, released on May 11, 2020.

Main changes are:

*   Make compatible with OTP-22
*   Fix a localtime problem for Theran/Iran timezone.
*   Fix for autostart of survey
*   Allow s3 filestore to retry on fetch errors
*   Add option to create a s3 bucket if it is not present

For the timezone and OTP-22 fix the following dependencies need to be updated:

*   mochiweb
*   qdate\_localtime

Easiest method is to delete the *deps* folder and let rebar refetch all dependencies.
