Released on 2010-04-19.



New modules
-----------

mod\_pubsub

Enables resource sharing over XMPP’s PubSub; share content between sites and get realtime updates when content changes. See: <http://scherpenisse.net/id/644>

mod\_search\_solr

Added a module which plugs into Zotonic’s search system to support Solr (<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>). Using Solr enables quick fulltext searching and facetting.



New features
------------

Default site improvements

The default site of a vanilla Zotonic install has been improved with nicer graphics, cleaner typography, a “contact form” example and styles for the Twitter module.

“More results” scomp

A twitter/facebook style ajaxified “read more” pager, which is a button which will fetch more results for the current search question inline on the same page.

Windows support

Initial support for building and running Zotonic on the Windows platform.

Database schema support

Multiple sites running inside one Postgres database is now possible thanks to Postgres’ support for multiple table namespaces (schema’s)

Template expressions

It is now possible to use full boolean and arithmetic expressions in the ErlyDTL templates.
