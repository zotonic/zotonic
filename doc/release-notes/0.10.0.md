Welcome Zotonic 0.10.0, released on April 18, 2014. These notes list the most important changes for this new feature release.



New core features
-----------------

The minimum required Erlang version is now release R15B03. Zotonic is always supporting up to major 2 versions behind the current stable Erlang release.

We now use the de-factor Erlang package manager rebar for the management of the subprojects.

Websocket / comet (re)connection handling have been greatly improved. A state machine now manages the process on the server and keeps the connection running also in the long run.

The Google Summer of Code-sponsored student Mawuli Adzaku provided excellent work on the Zotonic CLI for management (search, installation, ...) of external Zotonic modules such as those from <http://modules.zotonic.com/>

The media handling subsystem was heavily modified in this release. It is now much easier to add custom hooks to do custom media processing when a media file has been uploaded. The following notifications were added as extension points:

*   `#media_identify_extension{}` to make custom mappings from a mime-type to an extension
*   `#media_identify_file{}` to override media file identification
*   `#media_update_done{}` when the media metadata has been stored in the database

For SEO purposes, a new table rsc\_page\_path\_log was added, that tracks old page\_path names from [resources](/id/doc_glossary#term-resource) so that old urls keep working when the page path changes. Old URLs will be redirected to the new location instead.

Handling legacy username/password authentication can now be done by leveraging the new `#identity_password_match{}` notification.



New and updated modules
-----------------------

mod\_seo

The two modules mod\_seo and mod\_seo\_google have been merged into a single module. Support for Bing webmaster verification has been added.

mod\_artwork

This module now ships with the font-awesome icon set.

mod\_admin

A much requested feature to set the “center of gravity” for images has been added in the admin. The ‘crop’ filter takes this center into account.

mod\_admin\_frontend

This new module will provide admin-alike editing of resources, menu-trees and collections for non-admin users in the frontend of the website, by the re-use of admin templates in the frontend site. This module was backported to the 0.9 series.

mod\_admin\_stats

The admin stats module adds a new admin page presenting a live view of system statistics for things like number of requests, request processing times, database and cache queries etc.

mod\_custom\_redirect

This module provides hooks to redirect unknown request paths or hosts to other locations. It adds a page to the admin to define and maintian these redirects. This module was backported to the 0.9 series.

mod\_video

A new module for video conversion and playback. It uses theffmpeg tool to convert uploaded movies to h264 and generate a poster image. Included are default templates for movie playback.

mod\_mqtt

Interfaces to MQTT publish/subscribe topics. Adds publish/subscribe between the browser, server and modules. Includes access control and topic mapping for external MQTT applications.



Template system improvements
----------------------------

The template include system was made more powerful by adding options to force the runtime include of a template and to make the include optional (e.g. not crashing when a template is not found).

The option was added (to [mod\_development](/id/doc_module_mod_development)) to generate HTML comments with the paths to the included files embedded for easy debugging.

Besides this, the erlydtl\_runtime can now directly lookup values in mochiweb JSON structures, making template syntax more straighforward.
