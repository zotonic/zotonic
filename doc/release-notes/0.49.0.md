Welcome to Zotonic 0.49.0, released on May 6, 2019.

Main changes are:

*   **BC break:** Upgraded Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript in mod\_admin to 3.4.1; mod\_admin no longer ships with a separate Bootstrap instance but uses the one from mod\_bootstrap. Any customizations you made to the Bootstrap CSS will therefore be visible in the admin, too.
*   Logging: the `/admin/log` changed and now more useful. Events logged include module activation, config changes, rate limiting and ACL changes.
*   `mod_clamav` now also rejects MS Office files with `externalLinks` directories. This can be turned off using the Zotonic config key `clamav_reject_msoffice_external_links`
*   Uploaded CSV files are now given the mime type `text/csv` and properly sanitized
*   Password reset tokens are now valid for two days.
*   `mod_linkedin` now uses their v2 API
