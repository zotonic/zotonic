Welcome to Zotonic 0.58.0, released on November 2, 2020.

Main changes are:

*   `{% image %}` tags now have a width and height attribute, use the `nowh` option to suppress generation of the width and height attributes
*   Fix for a problem where an ACL deny rule could restrict too much
*   Support to store JSON in PostgreSQL
*   Fix a problem with Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn authentication and Safari 14
*   Fix a problem where very large dates could give unexpected results
*   Better TLS cipher suite selection for SSL connections
*   Allow custom formatters to show an error on empty input values

To fix sites that break on the width/height attributes on image tags there is an option added to the zotonic.config file: `media_tag_nowh`

If the `media_tag_nowh` option is set to `true` then all `{% image %}` tags have the `nowh` option added. Effectively suppressing the generation of width and height attributes.

Note that this option is *not* available on the 1.x version and later of Zotonic.

If you have css like:


```erlang
img {
    max-width: 100%;
}
```

Then add one line:


```erlang
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```
