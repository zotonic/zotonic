Welcome Zotonic 0.12.0, released on October 8, 2014.

This release has been released on the same day as [Release 0.11.0](/id/doc_releasenotes_rel_0.11.0#rel-0-11-0). The main difference between these 2 releases is that in 0.12, Bootstrap has been upgraded on all templates. 0.11 was released as a feature release with all major improvements of the last 6 months excluding Bootstrap 3 support.
