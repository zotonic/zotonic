Note

For upgrading to this release from an older Zotonic release, please read the [Upgrade notes](/id/doc_developerguide_upgrading#upgrade-notes) carefully, as some backward-incompatible changes have been made.

Welcome Zotonic 0.11.0, released on October 8, 2014. These notes list the most important changes for this new feature release.



Full timezone support
---------------------

Timezone support was added to the core. All dates are now stored in UTC. Existing resources with old dates (in local time!) are converted on read, assuming the configured server timezone. You need to set the timezone in the `zotonic.config` file, for example:


```erlang
{timezone, "Europe/Berlin"}
```

A site-specific timezone can de set with the `mod_l10n.timezone` configuration.



Database driver and pool
------------------------

The database driver and pool has been replaced by the standard `epgsql` and `poolboy` Erlang applications. This means we no longer use a special forked Zotonic version of the epgsql Postgres driver. As a nice side effect, database queries run 5-10% faster on the new database code. See the test report here: <https://gist.github.com/arjan/70e5ec0ecaf98b19a348>



### Global changes

The default place for user-defined sites and external modules has been changed to the defaults `user/sites` and `user/modules`, respectively.

Also, the global file `priv/config` has been obsoleted in place of a new global configuration file, `~/.zotonic/zotonic.config`. Zotonic actually looks in several places for its global configuration file, including `/etc/zotonic/zotonic.config`. See [Global configuration](/id/doc_developerguide_configuration_zotonic_configuration#guide-configuration) for all information on this topic.



Updated modules
---------------

mod\_l10n

Added timezone support.

mod\_development

Added dispatch debugging and explanation. Added checkbox to disable the api-service `/api/development/recompile`

mod\_mqtt

The [live](/id/doc_template_scomp_scomp_live#scomp-live) custom tag was added to [mod\_mqtt](/id/doc_module_mod_mqtt), allowing you to live update a part of the page on pubsub events. Documentation for [mod\_mqtt](/id/doc_module_mod_mqtt) has been improved and a debugging option has been added so you can see which topics are published and subscribed to.

mod\_base

The Zotonic logo is now included in the distribution as a Webfont, resulting in crisp logo’s in the admin and on the default Zotonic status website.



New an updated filters
----------------------

date

An optional second argument for the timezone has been added.

date\_range

An optional third argument for the timezone has been added.

truncate

An optional second argument is added to specify the text added where the text is truncated.

truncate\_html

Truncates a HTML text to a specific length, ensures that all open tags are properly closed.



New transport mechanism
-----------------------

The client-server communication is now based on UBF-encoded messages. It has become easier to send messages to specific pages (browser tabs) and to do bi-directional communication in general. See [Transport](/id/doc_developerguide_server_browser_interaction#guide-transport) for all information on this topic.



Misc
----

User-defined Erlang dependencies

It is now possible to add extra rebar `deps` to Zotonic, by adding them to the `zotonic.config` file.

Version-locking of dependent Erlang applications

Zotonic now uses the Rebar `lock-deps` plugin to keep all included dependencies at the versions that they were at when Zotonic was released. This improves the longterm stability of the Zotonic release.

Rememberme cookie changes

The *rememberme* cookie (used for automatic logon) is now based on a token instead of the user id. The token is reset if the user’s password is changed. Cookies set using the previous scheme are invalidated.

Reuqest context notification

Added the notification `request_context`. This is a foldl with the Context and is called after the request’s query arguments are parsed using `z_context:ensure_qs/1`. It can be used to perform transformations or actions based on the query arguments.
