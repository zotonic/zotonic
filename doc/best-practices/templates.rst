Template Best Practices and Pitfalls
====================================

This chapter lists some preferred solutions to common tasks and
pitfalls you may encounter while developing with templates.


Variable Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Name your variables for what they represent.  If you are searching for
articles, name the search result variable ``article`` to make things clear.

In particular, if you are iterating over a list or other iterable
variable called images, then your item variable should be named ``image``.
This makes generative templates easier to follow.

.. _best-practices-shortcut-syntax:

Use ``id`` instead of ``m.rsc``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the most frequently used model :ref:`model-rsc`, use a shortcut syntax:
write ``{{ id.title }}`` instead of ``{{ m.rsc[id].title }}``. So this:

.. code-block:: django

    <li>
      <h3>{{ m.rsc[id].title }}</h3>
      {% for image_id in m.rsc[id].o.depiction %}
      <figure>
          {% media image_id width=100 link=id %}
          {% if m.rsc[image_id].summary %}
              <p class="image-caption">{{ m.rsc[image_id].summary }}</p>
          {% endif %}
      </figure>
      {% endfor %}
    </li>

becomes:

.. code-block:: django

    <li>
        <h3>{{ id.title }}</h3>
        {% for image_id in id.o.depiction %}
        <figure>
          {% media image_id width=100 link=id %}
          {% if image_id.summary %}
              <p class="image-caption">{{ image_id.summary }}</p>
          {% endif %}
        </figure>
        {% endfor %}
    </li>

Pitfalls
^^^^^^^^

Using 'm' as a template variable blocks model access
....................................................

Avoid using the name ``m`` for a variable.  It has a special meaning
in templates for accessing models like :ref:`model-site` and
:ref:`model-rsc` as `m.site` and `m.rsc`.  Effectively. all Erlang
modules with names starting with `m_` are made available in templates
through the ``m`` variable.

It is particularly important since using m as a variable name will
disable model module access for the entire scope within which that
variable is defined.  This can lead to very confusing template errors.

Using 'id' as a template variable blocks access to the current page
...................................................................

When rendering a page through :ref:`controller-page`, Zotonic sets the
`id` variable based on the :term:`resource` (page) being rendered.  It
is also conventionally used by dispatch rules to supply the id of the
page to render.

Note, however, that there are legitmate cases for using id as a
template variable. It is a good idea to reuse another template to
render a section for one page and treating related content as the
"current page" for that template by assigning id in a for loop or with
context.  Using id otherwise will likely confuse other developers
trying to read your templates.
